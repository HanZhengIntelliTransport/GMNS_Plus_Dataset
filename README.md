# GMNS Plus Dataset

The **GMNS Plus Dataset** is a publicly available, standardized transportation network collection based on the [General Modeling Network Specification (GMNS)](https://github.com/zephyr-data-specs/GMNS). This project aims to support reproducible and comparable research in transportation modeling, planning, and analysis.

Led by NSF POSE Team from **Arizona State University (ASU)**, the project is supported by the **National Science Foundation (NSF)** under the following initiative:

> **POSE: Phase II: CONNECT**  
> *[Consortium of Open-source plaNNing models for Next-generation Equitable and efficient Communities and Transportation](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2303748&HistoricalAwards=false)*  
> **Award #: 2303748**

The dataset currently includes networks from a diverse set of cities and regions around the world:

```
01_Anaheim  
02_Berlin-Center  
03_Berlin-Friedrichshain  
04_Berlin-Mitte-Center  
05_Berlin-Mitte-Prenzlauerberg-Friedrichshain-Center  
06_Berlin-Prenzlauerberg-Center
07_Berlin-Tiergarten  
08_Birmingham-England  
09_Chicago_Regional  
10_Chicago_Sketch  
11_GoldCoast  
12_Philadelphia  
13_Phoenix  
14_Sioux_Falls  
15_Sydney
```

These networks are formatted in GMNS to enable consistency, interoperability, and ease of use in academic and applied transportation research.


## Network Generation from OpenStreetMap Tools

Many of the networks in this dataset‚Äîsuch as **13_Phoenix**‚Äîare generated using a set of open-source tools, including [OSM2GMNS](https://osm2gmns.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). These tools convert OpenStreetMap (OSM) data into GMNS-compliant formats, allowing for automated, transparent, and scalable network generation.

All generated networks undergo detailed verification to ensure structural integrity and suitability for simulation and modeling tasks.

Looking ahead, the project aims to scale this effort to cover:
- **All 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia**
- **Major international metropolitan areas**, including **Tokyo**

This expansion will further support global transportation research with standardized, high-quality network data.


## TNTP-to-GMNS Conversion and Standardization

Another key component of this project is the conversion and standardization of legacy TNTP-format networks into the GMNS format. This work ensures that valuable historical datasets can be integrated into modern modeling pipelines and benefit from the standardized structure provided by GMNS.

We thank the TNTP team for making these important datasets available to the research community.

## Differences Between Original TNTP and GMNS Format

While the original TNTP datasets are comprehensive and widely used, their formats differ slightly from the GMNS specification. As part of this project, we have developed a standardized conversion process to align TNTP networks with GMNS requirements.

This process includes:
- **Schema unification**: Adjusting field names, data structures, and file formats to conform to GMNS standards.
- **Validation and documentation**: Logs and memos detailing the integration and modification steps are available in the `Documents` directory.
- **Handling incomplete networks**: Some TNTP datasets are missing node information or other structural components. These networks are currently stored in the `Incomplete_Networks` folder and will be completed and released in future updates.

This alignment enables consistent data handling, easier model integration, and improved reproducibility across research projects.

## Multi-Level Modeling Readiness and Validation Framework

To guarantee both structural integrity and modeling usability, the Global Dataset project introduces a standardized multi-level modeling readiness and validation framework. This framework ensures that each dataset is not only complete and internally consistent but also fully prepared for simulation, performance analysis, and data-driven applications. From basic file checks to ODME preparation and traffic assignment validation, each level addresses a key aspect of model-readiness, offering a systematic path from raw data to reliable outputs.
### üîç Level 1: Basic Data File Validation
- **File Existence**: Confirms that `node.csv` and `link.csv` files exist and are readable.
- **Required Fields & Data Types**: Verifies essential fields (e.g., `node_id`, `link_id`) and their data types (e.g., integers for IDs, floats for coordinates or speeds).
- **Sorted Data Structure**: Ensures nodes are sorted by `node_id`, and links by `from_node_id` and `to_node_id`.
- **Link Endpoints**: Checks that all link endpoints are valid and exist in the node file.

### üåê Level 2: Demand and Zone Consistency
- **Zone Centroids**: Validates that each zone has a matching centroid node (`node_id == zone_id`), grouped at the top of the node list.
- **Connector Links**: Identifies and checks connector links from centroids to the main network.
- **Demand File Structure**: Confirms that the demand file has exactly three columns (`o_zone_id`, `d_zone_id`, `volume`) in the correct order.
- **Zone Consistency Across Files**: Ensures that all zones referenced in the demand file exist in the node file.

### üìè Level 3: Network Attributes Validation
- **Speed and Length Units**: Verifies that speeds are in consistent units (e.g., km/h, mph) and link lengths are properly measured (e.g., meters vs. miles).
- **Capacity Values**: Checks that capacities are within reasonable bounds and consistent with expected per-lane capacities.
- **Unit Conversions**: Validates field consistency based on standard conversion factors (e.g., meters to miles).
- **VDF Parameters**: Confirms that Volume Delay Function (VDF) fields (e.g., `vdf_alpha`, `vdf_beta`) are present, non-negative, and reasonable.

### üöó Level 4: Single Mode Configuration Validation
- **Configuration Files**: Confirms presence and formatting of files like `mode_type.csv` and `settings.csv`.
- **Single Mode Requirement**: Checks that only one mode is defined, with warnings if multiple modes are found in single-mode setups.
- **Parameter Consistency**: Ensures simulation parameters (e.g., number of iterations, demand period length) are within reasonable and expected limits.

### üìä Level 5: Observed Volume Checks and ODME Preparation
- **Observed Volumes**: Validates `obs_volume` fields in the link file (e.g., no negatives, sufficient coverage).
- **ODME Requirements**: Prepares the network for Origin-Destination Matrix Estimation (ODME) by confirming that enough quality observed volume data exists.

### üõ∞Ô∏è Level 6: Accessibility Assessment
- **OD Connectivity**: Checks `od_performance.csv` to ensure OD pairs with demand have feasible paths.
- **Route Assignments (optional)**: Validates additional route assignment data, if available.
- **Accessibility Metrics**: Computes accessibility indicators (e.g., number of destinations per origin) and flags cases with insufficient connectivity.

### üõ£Ô∏è Level 7: Traffic Assignment Validation
- **Link and Route Performance**: Analyzes outputs like total assigned volume, VMT, VHT, and average speeds.
- **Statistical Comparisons**: Compares assigned volumes against reference/observed volumes using metrics like R¬≤, RMSE, and MAPE.
- **Route Consistency**: Ensures that route probability distributions are valid (e.g., sum to 1 per OD pair) and congestion levels are realistic.

### üß™ Level 8: Extended ODME Post-Quality Checks
- **Target Demand Matching**: Checks whether ODME-adjusted demands match target values.
- **Feasible High-Demand Paths**: Verifies that high-demand OD pairs are assigned feasible routes with acceptable travel times.
- **Outlier Identification**: Flags route and volume anomalies to maintain network quality.

## GMNS Tools and Visualization Support

In addition to the datasets and validation framework, this repository also provides a set of **common tools and utilities for working with GMNS networks**, including:

- üõ† **Scripts in `GMNS_Tools/`**: These include frequently used data preprocessing and conversion utilities to support tasks such as format transformation, attribute completion, and batch validation.

- üìä **Visualization via [NEXTA](https://github.com/asu-trans-ai-lab/NeXTA4GMNS)**: A lightweight network visualization and analysis platform built to support GMNS-compatible networks, allowing users to explore topology, traffic volume, and accessibility results.

- üö¶ **Network Accessibility Checks with [DTALite](https://github.com/itsfangtang/DTALite_release)**: The DTALite simulator is used to evaluate network connectivity and perform accessibility analysis across origin-destination (OD) pairs.

These tools work together to streamline the process of data verification, simulation readiness, and visual inspection of network structures.


## How to Use the Multi-Level Validation Tool

You can run the **multi-level data validation process** using the script `Network_Validator_Main.py`.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è To validate all networks in the current directory:

```bash
python Network_Validator_Main.py
```

This will:
- Automatically detect all subdirectories containing network data,
- Perform validation across all defined levels (1‚Äì8),
- And generate a **detailed validation report** for each network.

---

### üéØ To validate a specific network only:

Open the script and modify the following line:

```python
subdirectories = get_all_directories('.')
```

Change `'.'` to the name of the folder you want to validate.  
For example, to validate only the **Sydney** network:

```python
subdirectories = get_all_directories('16_Sydney')
```

This allows you to selectively check a single network without scanning the entire directory.

---

The validation results will be saved in output files that summarize which levels passed, failed, or triggered warnings, making it easier to identify and fix data issues.
